[Fast Fourier Transform]
- One of the more interesting algorithms in number theory is the Fast Fourier transform (FFT). 
- FFTs are a key building block in many algorithms, including 
* extremely fast multiplication of large numbers (https://www.math.clemson.edu/~sgao/papers/GM10.pdf),
* multiplication of polynomials, and
* extremely fast generatioon and recovery of erasure codes (https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/16/secret-sharing-erasure-coding-guide-aspiring-dropbox-decentralizer).
